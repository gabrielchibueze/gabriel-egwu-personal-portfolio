                <h2>#. Master of Science in Engineering Management</h2>
                <p>In January 2024, I concluded my MSc. program in Engineering management with Advance practice with a Distinction in te prestigious Northumbria University Newcastle United Kingdom. Northumbria University is a hallmark of research and development which lead to an award of the 2023 Best University of the year in Higher Times Education.</p>
                <h3>Core Modules Studies</h3>
                <p>The course modules in selected by Northumbria univserity focused on the core traits expected in an engineering and project manager. This couses addressed issues relating to product developement, Sustainability, how engineering manageers should generate and utilise data for engineering efficiency and the importance of project change, change management in projects, programs and portfolio management.</p>
                <p>Below are the major courses I did in this program:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Project change, risk and opportunities management</li>
                    <li>Project, Programme and Portfolio Management</li>
